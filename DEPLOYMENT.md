## Manual Deployment

For traditional hosting providers:

1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Copy files**
   - Upload the `.next` folder
   - Upload `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
   - Upload `next.config.ts`

3. **Install dependencies on server**
   ```bash
   npm install --production
   ```

4. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Environment Variables

The application doesn't require any environment variables for basic functionality:

- **API Keys**: Users input their Apify API tokens directly in the application
- **Configuration**: All settings are handled client-side or through Next.js defaults

## Performance Optimization

For production deployments:

1. **Enable compression** (most platforms do this automatically)
2. **Use CDN** for static assets (Vercel and Netlify provide this)
3. **Monitor performance** with built-in analytics

## Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Never stored server-side, handled securely through the app
- **HTTPS**: Required for production (all recommended platforms provide this)
- **Headers**: Security headers configured in `next.config.ts`

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
- Ensure Node.js version is 18+
- Check for missing dependencies: `npm install`
- Verify TypeScript compilation: `npm run type-check`

### Runtime Errors
- Check browser console for client-side errors
- Verify API endpoints are accessible
- Test with different Apify API keys

## Monitoring

Once deployed, monitor your application:

- **Vercel**: Built-in analytics and monitoring
- **Netlify**: Analytics and form submissions
- **Railway**: Application metrics and logs

Choose the platform that best fits your needs. For most users, **Vercel** provides the smoothest experience with Next.js applications.

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check Node.js version (18+ required)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Run `npm run build` locally first

2. **Runtime Errors**
   - Check browser console for client-side errors
   - Verify Apify API accessibility
   - Check CORS configuration if needed

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Enable platform-specific optimizations
   - Check bundle size with `npm run build`
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals

### Support:
- Check platform-specific documentation
- Review deployment logs
- Test locally with `npm run build && npm start`
